This repo contains the associated data files and code for Zhang et al 2022, "Tropical cyclone impacts on seagrass-associated fishes in a temperate-subtropical estuary" published at PLOS ONE. 

The HurricaneFish_AllStats.Rmd file does the following:

1. Load packages and functions needed to run the code 
2. Prepare and subset the fish and hurricane intensity data based upon a BACI framework. 
3. Runs ANOVAs, GAMs, GLMS, community structure analyses to determine if fishes are affected by hurricanes.
4. Runs exploratory data analysis on seagrass percent cover at four meadows in the study area to examine hurricane-related changes in seagrass cover.
5. Creates figures for the manuscript

All data files (.xlsx) contain a secondary tab with associated metadata.
